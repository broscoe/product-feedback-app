# 📝 Product Feedback App

## 📌 Description

- This is a full stack application for tracking feedback to a (mock) companies website and allows the user to submit new suggestions for changes for the company to make.
- I built this project to solidify my newly learned full stack development skills into a project fully built by me with no external APIs.
